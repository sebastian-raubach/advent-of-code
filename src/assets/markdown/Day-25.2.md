The light turns green and the door unlocks. As you collapse onto the bed in your room, your pager goes off!

"It's an emergency!" the Elf calling you explains. "The [soft serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_serve) machine in the cafeteria on sub-basement 7 just failed and you're the only one that knows how to fix it! We've already dispatched a reindeer to your location to pick you up."

You hear the sound of hooves landing on your balcony.

The reindeer carefully explores the contents of your room while you figure out how you're going to pay the *50 stars* you owe the resort before you leave. Noticing that you look concerned, the reindeer wanders over to you; you see that it's carrying a small pouch.

"Sorry for the trouble," a note in the pouch reads. Sitting at the bottom of the pouch is a gold coin with a little picture of a starfish on it.

Looks like you only needed *49 stars* after all.
