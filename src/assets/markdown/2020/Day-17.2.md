For some reason, your simulated results don't match what the experimental energy source engineers expected. Apparently, the pocket dimension actually has **four spatial dimensions**, not three.

The pocket dimension contains an infinite 4-dimensional grid. At every integer 4-dimensional coordinate (`x,y,z,w`), there exists a single cube (really, a **hypercube**) which is still either **active** or **inactive**.

Each cube only ever considers its **neighbors**: any of the 80 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most `1`. For example, given the cube at `x=1,y=2,z=3,w=4`, its neighbors include the cube at `x=2,y=2,z=3,w=3`, the cube at `x=0,y=2,z=3,w=4`, and so on.

The initial state of the pocket dimension still consists of a small flat region of cubes. Furthermore, the same rules for cycle updating still apply: during each cycle, consider the **number of active neighbors** of each cube.

For example, consider the same initial state as in the example above. Even though the pocket dimension is 4-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1x1 region of the 4-dimensional space.)

Simulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given `z` and `w` coordinate:

```
Before any cycles:

z=0, w=0
.#.

After 1 cycle:

z=-1, w=-1

z=0, w=-1

After 2 cycles:

After the full six-cycle boot process completes, **`848`** cubes are left in the **active** state.

Starting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles in a 4-dimensional space. **How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?**
