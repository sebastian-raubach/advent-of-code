Now that you've isolated the inert ingredients, you should have enough information to figure out which ingredient contains which allergen.

In the above example:

- `mxmxvkd` contains `dairy`.
- `sqjhc` contains `fish`.
- `fvjkl` contains `soy`.

Arrange the ingredients **alphabetically by their allergen** and separate them by commas to produce your **canonical dangerous ingredient list**. (There should **not be any spaces** in your canonical dangerous ingredient list.) In the above example, this would be **`mxmxvkd,sqjhc,fvjkl`**.

Time to stock your raft with supplies. **What is your canonical dangerous ingredient list?**
