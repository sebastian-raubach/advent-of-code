According to your calculations, the Elves are going to lose badly. Surely, you won't mess up the timeline too much if you give them just a little advanced technology, right?

You need to make sure the Elves not only **win**, but also suffer **no losses**: even the death of a single Elf is unacceptable.

However, you can't go too far: larger changes will be more likely to permanently alter spacetime.

So, you need to **find the outcome** of the battle in which the Elves have the **lowest integer attack power** (at least `4`) that allows them to **win without a single death**. The Goblins always have an attack power of `3`.

In the first summarized example above, the lowest attack power the Elves need to win without losses is `15`:

```
#######       #######
#.G...#       #..E..#   E(158)
#...EG#       #...E.#   E(14)
#.#.#G#  -->  #.#.#.#
#..G#E#       #...#.#
#.....#       #.....#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 29 full rounds
Elves win with 172 total hit points left
Outcome: 29 * 172 = 4988
```

In the second example above, the Elves need only `4` attack power:

```
#######       #######
#E..EG#       #.E.E.#   E(200), E(23)
#.#G.E#       #.#E..#   E(200)
#E.##E#  -->  #E.##E#   E(125), E(200)
#G..#.#       #.E.#.#   E(200)
#..E#.#       #...#.#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 33 full rounds
Elves win with 948 total hit points left
Outcome: 33 * 948 = 31284
```

In the third example above, the Elves need `15` attack power:

```
#######       #######
#E.G#.#       #.E.#.#   E(8)
#.#G..#       #.#E..#   E(86)
#G.#.G#  -->  #..#..#
#G..#.#       #...#.#
#...E.#       #.....#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 37 full rounds
Elves win with 94 total hit points left
Outcome: 37 * 94 = 3478
```

In the fourth example above, the Elves need `12` attack power:

```
#######       #######
#.E...#       #...E.#   E(14)
#.#..G#       #.#..E#   E(152)
#.###.#  -->  #.###.#
#E#G#G#       #.#.#.#
#...#G#       #...#.#
#######       #######

Combat ends after 39 full rounds
Elves win with 166 total hit points left
Outcome: 39 * 166 = 6474
```

In the last example above, the lone Elf needs `34` attack power:

```
#########       #########   
#G......#       #.......#   
#.E.#...#       #.E.#...#   E(38)
#..##..G#       #..##...#   
#...##..#  -->  #...##..#   
#...#...#       #...#...#   
#.G...G.#       #.......#   
#.....G.#       #.......#   
#########       #########   

Combat ends after 30 full rounds
Elves win with 38 total hit points left
Outcome: 30 * 38 = 1140
```

After increasing the Elves' attack power until it is just barely enough for them to win without any Elves dying, **what is the outcome** of the combat described in your puzzle input?
