    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is my <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> solution for 2020 as well as some previous years that I'll add as I finish them.</p>
    <p>I decided to switch from Java (2019) to Javascript this time around to make things a bit more intersting.</p>
    <p>The source code for this website is hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sebastian-raubach/advent-of-code-2020">https://github.com/sebastian-raubach/advent-of-code-2020</a></p>
