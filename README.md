# Advent of Code

## About

This is the repository for my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solution.

I've been using the following technologies:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend.
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management.
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for some charts.
- [Bootstrap-Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) for the interface.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions) for CI/CD.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.

The deployed result is available at: https://sebastian-raubach.github.io/advent-of-code/
