The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid.

The middle password, `cdefg`, is not; it contains no instances of `b`, but needs at least `1`.

They ask if you can take a look.\n\nYou narrow the problem down to a strange **infinite loop** in the boot code (your puzzle input) of the device. You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.\n\nThe boot code is represented as a text file with one **instruction** per line of text. Each instruction consists of an **operation** (`acc`, `jmp`, or `nop`) and an **argument** (a signed number like `+4` or `-20`).\n\n- `acc` increases or decreases a single global value called the **accumulator** by the value given in the argument. For example, `acc +7` would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at `0`. After an `acc` instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.\n- `jmp` **jumps** to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an **offset** from the `jmp` instruction; for example, `jmp +2` would skip the next instruction, `jmp +1` would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and `jmp -20` would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.\n- `nop` stands for **No OPeration** - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\n```\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\n```\n\nThese instructions are visited in this order:\n\n```\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2, 8(!)\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  | 6\njmp -3  | 7\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\njmp -4  | 5\nacc +6  |\n```\n\nFirst, the `nop +0` does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (`acc +1`) and `jmp +4` sets the next instruction to the other `acc +1` near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, `jmp -4` executes, setting the next instruction to the only `acc +3`. It sets the accumulator to 5, and `jmp -3` causes the program to continue back at the first `acc +1`.\n\nThis is an **infinite loop**: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.\n\nImmediately **before** the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is **`5`**.\n\nRun your copy of the boot code.

Upon connection, the port outputs a series of numbers (your puzzle input).\n\nThe data appears to be encrypted with the eXchange-Masking Addition System (XMAS) which, conveniently for you, is an old cypher with an important weakness.\n\nXMAS starts by transmitting a **preamble** of 25 numbers. After that, each number you receive should be the sum of any two of the 25 immediately previous numbers. The two numbers will have different values, and there might be more than one such pair.\n\nFor example, suppose your preamble consists of the numbers `1` through `25` in a random order. To be valid, the next number must be the sum of two of those numbers:\n\n- `26` would be a **valid** next number, as it could be `1` plus `25` (or many other pairs, like `2` and `24`).\n- `49` would be a **valid** next number, as it is the sum of `24` and `25`.\n- `100` would **not** be valid; no two of the previous 25 numbers sum to `100`.\n- `50` would also **not** be valid; although `25` appears in the previous 25 numbers, the two numbers in the pair must be different.\n\nSuppose the 26th number is `45`, and the first number (no longer an option, as it is more than 25 numbers ago) was `20`. Now, for the next number to be valid, there needs to be some pair of numbers among `1`-`19`, `21`-`25`, or `45` that add up to it:\n\n- `26` would still be a **valid** next number, as `1` and `25` are still within the previous 25 numbers.\n- `65` would **not** be valid, as no two of the available numbers sum to it.\n- `64` and `66` would both be **valid**, as they are the result of `19+45` and `21+45` respectively.\n\nHere is a larger example which only considers the previous **5** numbers (and has a preamble of length 5):\n\n```\n35\n20\n15\n25\n47\n40\n62\n55\n65\n95\n102\n117\n150\n182\n127\n219\n299\n277\n309\n576\n```\n\nIn this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two of the previous 5 numbers; the only number that does not follow this rule is **`127`**.\n\nThe first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. **What is the first number that does not have this property?**"},"44e7":function(e,t,n){var o=n("861d"),a=n("c6b6"),r=n("b622"),i=r("match");e.exports=function(e){var t;return o(e)&&(void 0!==(t=e[i])?!!t:"RegExp"==a(e))}},"4a87":function(e,t,n){"use strict";var o=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",[n("h1",[e._v("Day "+e._s(e.day))]),e.markdown&&e.markdown.partOne?n("div",{staticClass:"mb-3"},[n("b-button",{directives:[{name:"b-toggle",rawName:"v-b-toggle.part-one",modifiers:{"part-one":!0}}]},[e._v("Show Part 1")]),n("b-collapse",{attrs:{id:"part-one"}},[n("vue-markdown",{attrs:{source:e.markdown.partOne}})],1)],1):e._e(),e.markdown&&e.markdown.partTwo?n("div",{staticClass:"mb-3"},[n("b-button",{directives:[{name:"b-toggle",rawName:"v-b-toggle.part-two",modifiers:{"part-two":!0}}]},[e._v("Show Part 2")]),n("b-collapse",{attrs:{id:"part-two"}},[n("vue-markdown",{attrs:{source:e.markdown.partTwo}})],1)],1):e._e(),n("h2",[e._v("Input")]),n("b-form",{on:{submit:function(t){return t.preventDefault(),e.onSubmit(t)}}},[n("b-form-group",{attrs:{label:"Task input",description:"The task input provided for this day.","label-for":"task-input"}},[n("b-form-textarea",{attrs:{rows:"5",id:"task-input",disabled:!e.editingEnabled},model:{value:e.input,callback:function(t){e.input=t},expression:"input"}})],1),n("b-button",{attrs:{type:"submit"},on:{click:function(t){return t.preventDefault(),e.onSubmit(t)}}},[e._v("Run")])],1),void 0!==e.solutions.partOne&&null!==e.solutions.partOne?[n("h2",{staticClass:"mt-3"},[e._v("Solution Part 1")]),e._t("partOne"),n("p",[e._v(e._s(e.solutions.partOne))])]:e._e(),void 0!==e.solutions.partTwo&&null!==e.solutions.partTwo?[n("h2",[e._v("Solution Part 2")]),e._t("partTwo"),n("p",[e._v(e._s(e.solutions.partTwo))])]:e._e()],2)},a=[],r=(n("a9e3"),n("ac1f"),n("1276"),n("5530")),i=n("2f62"),s={data:function(){return{input:null}},props:{day:{type:Number,default:1},solutions:{type:Object,default:function(){return{partOne:null,partTwo:null}}},taskInput:{type:String,default:null}},watch:{taskInput:function(e){this.input=e}},computed:Object(r["a"])(Object(r["a"])({},Object(i["b"])(["editingEnabled"])),{},{markdown:function(){var e,t;try{e=n("9e50")("./Day-".concat(this.day,".1.md"))}catch(o){}try{t=n("819c")("./Day-".concat(this.day,".2.md"))}catch(o){}return{partOne:e?e.default:null,partTwo:t?t.default:null}},splitData:function(){return this.input?this.input.split(/\r?\n/):null}}),methods:{onSubmit:function(){this.$emit("input-changed",this.splitData)}},mounted:function(){this.taskInput&&(this.input=this.taskInput)}},l=s,h=n("2877"),u=Object(h["a"])(l,o,a,!1,null,null,null);t["a"]=u.exports},5899:function(e,t){e.exports="\t\n\v\f\r                　\u2028\u2029\ufeff"},"58a8":function(e,t,n){var o=n("1d80"),a=n("5899"),r="["+a+"]",i=RegExp("^"+r+r+"*"),s=RegExp(r+r+"*$"),l=function(e){return function(t){var n=String(o(t));return 1&e&&(n=n.replace(i,"")),2&e&&(n=n.replace(s,"")),n}};e.exports={start:l(1),end:l(2),trim:l(3)}},"59f7":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t["default"]="After saving Christmas [five years in a row](https://adventofcode.com/events), you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island.

The expected fields are as follows:\n\n- `byr` (Birth Year)\n- `iyr` (Issue Year)\n- `eyr` (Expiration Year)\n- `hgt` (Height)\n- `hcl` (Hair Color)\n- `ecl` (Eye Color)\n- `pid` (Passport ID)\n- `cid` (Country ID)\n\nPassport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport is represented as a sequence of `key:value` pairs separated by spaces or newlines. Passports are separated by blank lines.\n\nHere is an example batch file containing four passports:\n\n```\necl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd\nbyr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm\n\niyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884\nhcl:#cfa07d byr:1929\n\nhcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013\neyr:2024\necl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931\nhgt:179cm\n\nhcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648\niyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in\n```\n\nThe first passport is **valid** - all eight fields are present. The second passport is **invalid** - it is missing hgt (the Height field).\n\nThe third passport is interesting; the **only missing field** is `cid`, so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing `cid` fields. Treat this \"passport\" as **valid**.\n\nThe fourth passport is missing two fields, `cid` and `byr`. Missing `cid` is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is **invalid**.\n\nAccording to the above rules, your improved system would report `2` valid passports.\n\nCount the number of **valid** passports - those that have all required fields.

You aren\'t sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.\n\nYou write a quick program to use your phone\'s camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.\n\nInstead of [zones or groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo), this airline uses **binary space partitioning** to seat people. A seat might be specified like `FBFBBFFRLR`, where `F` means "front", `B` means "back", `L` means "left", and `R` means "right".\n\nThe first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the **128 rows** on the plane (numbered `0` through `127`). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the **front** (0 through 63) or the **back** (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you\'re left with exactly one row.\n\nFor example, consider just the first seven characters of `FBFBBFFRLR`:\n\n- Start by considering the whole range, rows `0` through `127`.\n- `F` means to take the lower half, keeping rows `0` through `63`.\n- `B` means to take the upper half, keeping rows `32` through `63`.\n- `F` means to take the lower half, keeping rows `32` through `47`.\n- `B` means to take the upper half, keeping rows `40` through `47`.\n- `B` keeps rows `44` through `47`.\n- `F` keeps rows `44` through `45`.\n- The final `F` keeps the lower of the two, row `44`.\n\nThe last three characters will be either `L` or `R`; these specify exactly one of the **8 columns** of seats on the plane (numbered `0` through `7`). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. `L` means to keep the **lower half**, while `R` means to keep the **upper half**.\n\nFor example, consider just the last 3 characters of `FBFBBFFRLR`:\n\n- Start by considering the whole range, columns `0` through `7`.\n- `R` means to take the upper half, keeping columns `4` through `7`.\n- `L` means to take the lower half, keeping columns `4` through `5`.\n- The final `R` keeps the upper of the two, column `5`.\n\nSo, decoding `FBFBBFFRLR` reveals that it is the seat at **row `44`, column `5`**.\n\nEvery seat also has a unique **seat ID**: multiply the row by `8`, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID `44 * 8 + 5 = 357`.\n\nHere are some other boarding passes:\n\n- `BFFFBBFRRR`: row `70`, column `7`, seat ID `567`.\n- `FFFBBBFRRR`: row `14`, column `7`, seat ID `119`.\n- `BBFFBBFRLL`: row `102`, column `4`, seat ID `820`.\n\nAs a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. **What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?**'},"7c55":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t["default"]="The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation.

Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!\n\nFor example, consider the following rules:\n\n```\nlight red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\ndark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\nbright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\nmuted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.\nshiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.\ndark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.\nvibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.\nfaded blue bags contain no other bags.\ndotted black bags contain no other bags.\n```\n\nThese rules specify the required contents for `9` bag types.
