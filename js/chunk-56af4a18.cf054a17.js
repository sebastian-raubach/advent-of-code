It must be using **version 2** of the decoder chip!\n\nA version 2 decoder chip doesn't modify the values being written at all. Instead, it acts as a [memory address decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvfhANgLrm4). Immediately before a value is written to memory, each bit in the bitmask modifies the corresponding bit of the destination **memory address** in the following way:\n\n- If the bitmask bit is `0`, the corresponding memory address bit is **unchanged**.\n- If the bitmask bit is `1`, the corresponding memory address bit is **overwritten with `1`**.\n- If the bitmask bit is `X`, the corresponding memory address bit is **floating**.\n\nA **floating** bit is not connected to anything and instead fluctuates unpredictably. In practice, this means the floating bits will take on **all possible values**, potentially causing many memory addresses to be written all at once!\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\n```\nmask = 000000000000000000000000000000X1001X\nmem[42] = 100\nmask = 00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX\nmem[26] = 1\n```\n\nWhen this program goes to write to memory address `42`, it first applies the bitmask:\n\n```\naddress: 000000000000000000000000000000101010  (decimal 42)\nmask:    000000000000000000000000000000X1001X\nresult:  000000000000000000000000000000X1101X\n```\n\nAfter applying the mask, four bits are overwritten, three of which are different, and two of which are **floating**. Floating bits take on every possible combination of values; with two floating bits, four actual memory addresses are written:\n\n```\n000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\n000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)\n000000000000000000000000000000111010  (decimal 58)\n000000000000000000000000000000111011  (decimal 59)\n```\n\nNext, the program is about to write to memory address `26` with a different bitmask:\n\n```\naddress: 000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\nmask:    00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX\nresult:  00000000000000000000000000000001X0XX\n```\n\nThis results in an address with three floating bits, causing writes to **eight** memory addresses:\n```\n000000000000000000000000000000010000  (decimal 16)\n000000000000000000000000000000010001  (decimal 17)\n000000000000000000000000000000010010  (decimal 18)\n000000000000000000000000000000010011  (decimal 19)\n000000000000000000000000000000011000  (decimal 24)\n000000000000000000000000000000011001  (decimal 25)\n000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\n000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)\n```\n\nThe entire 36-bit address space still begins initialized to the value 0 at every address, and you still need the sum of all values left in memory at the end of the program.

Since you have some spare time, you might as well see if there was anything interesting in the image the Mythical Information Bureau satellite captured.\n\nAfter decoding the satellite messages, you discover that the data actually contains many small images created by the satellite's **camera array**. The camera array consists of many cameras; rather than produce a single square image, they produce many smaller square image **tiles** that need to be **reassembled back into a single image**.\n\nEach camera in the camera array returns a single monochrome **image tile** with a random unique **ID number**. The tiles (your puzzle input) arrived in a random order.\n\nWorse yet, the camera array appears to be malfunctioning: each image tile has been **rotated and flipped to a random orientation**. Your first task is to reassemble the original image by orienting the tiles so they fit together.\n\nTo show how the tiles should be reassembled, each tile's image data includes a border that should line up exactly with its adjacent tiles. All tiles have this border, and the border lines up exactly when the tiles are both oriented correctly. Tiles at the edge of the image also have this border, but the outermost edges won't line up with any other tiles.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following nine tiles:\n\n```\nTile 2311:\n..##.#..#.\n##..#.....\n#...##..#.\n####.#...#\n##.##.###.\n##...#.###\n.#.#.#..##\n..#....#..\n###...#.#.\n..###..###\n\nTile 1951:\n#.##...##.\n#.####...#\n.....#..##\n#...######\n.##.#....#\n.###.#####\n###.##.##.\n.###....#.\n..#.#..#.#\n#...##.#..\n\nTile 1171:\n####...##.\n#..##.#..#\n##.#..#.#.\n.###.####.\n..###.####\n.##....##.\n.#...####.\n#.##.####.\n####..#...\n.....##...\n\nTile 1427:\n###.##.#..\n.#..#.##..\n.#.##.#..#\n#.#.#.##.#\n....#...##\n...##..##.\n...#.#####\n.#.####.#.\n..#..###.#\n..##.#..#.\n\nTile 1489:\n##.#.#....\n..##...#..\n.##..##...\n..#...#...\n#####...#.\n#..#.#.#.#\n...#.#.#..\n##.#...##.\n..##.##.##\n###.##.#..\n\nTile 2473:\n#....####.\n#..#.##...\n#.##..#...\n######.#.#\n.#...#.#.#\n.#########\n.###.#..#.\n########.#\n##...##.#.\n..###.#.#.\n\nTile 2971:\n..#.#....#\n#...###...\n#.#.###...\n##.##..#..\n.#####..##\n.#..####.#\n#..#.#..#.\n..####.###\n..#.#.###.\n...#.#.#.#\n\nTile 2729:\n...#.#.#.#\n####.#....\n..#.#.....\n....#..#.#\n.##..##.#.\n.#.####...\n####.#.#..\n##.####...\n##..#.##..\n#.##...##.\n\nTile 3079:\n#.#.#####.\n.#..######\n..#.......\n######....\n####.#..#.\n.#...#.##.\n#.#####.##\n..#.###...\n..#.......\n..#.###...\n```\n\nBy rotating, flipping, and rearranging them, you can find a square arrangement that causes all adjacent borders to line up:\n\n```\n#...##.#.. ..###..### #.#.#####.\n..#.#..#.# ###...#.#. .#..######\n.###....#. ..#....#.. ..#.......\n###.##.##. .#.#.#..## ######....\n.###.##### ##...#.### ####.#..#.\n.##.#....# ##.##.###. .#...#.##.\n#...###### ####.#...# #.#####.##\n.....#..## #...##..#. ..#.###...\n#.####...# ##..#..... ..#.......\n#.##...##. ..##.#..#. ..#.###...\n\n#.##...##. ..##.#..#. ..#.###...\n##..#.##.. ..#..###.# ##.##....#\n##.####... .#.####.#. ..#.###..#\n####.#.#.. ...#.##### ###.#..###\n.#.####... ...##..##. .######.##\n.##..##.#. ....#...## #.#.#.#...\n....#..#.# #.#.#.##.# #.###.###.\n..#.#..... .#.##.#..# #.###.##..\n####.#.... .#..#.##.. .######...\n...#.#.#.# ###.##.#.. .##...####\n\n...#.#.#.# ###.##.#.. .##...####\n..#.#.###. ..##.##.## #..#.##..#\n..####.### ##.#...##. .#.#..#.##\n#..#.#..#. ...#.#.#.. .####.###.\n.#..####.# #..#.#.#.# ####.###..\n.#####..## #####...#. .##....##.\n##.##..#.. ..#...#... .####...#.\n#.#.###... .##..##... .####.##.#\n#...###... ..##...#.. ...#..####\n..#.#....# ##.#.#.... ...##.....\n```\n\nFor reference, the IDs of the above tiles are:\n\n```\n1951    2311    3079\n2729    1427    2473\n2971    1489    1171\n```\n\nTo check that you've assembled the image correctly, multiply the IDs of the four corner tiles together.

You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.\n\nThe boot code is represented as a text file with one **instruction** per line of text. Each instruction consists of an **operation** (`acc`, `jmp`, or `nop`) and an **argument** (a signed number like `+4` or `-20`).\n\n- `acc` increases or decreases a single global value called the **accumulator** by the value given in the argument. For example, `acc +7` would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at `0`. After an `acc` instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.\n- `jmp` **jumps** to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an **offset** from the `jmp` instruction; for example, `jmp +2` would skip the next instruction, `jmp +1` would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and `jmp -20` would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.\n- `nop` stands for **No OPeration** - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\n```\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\n```\n\nThese instructions are visited in this order:\n\n```\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2, 8(!)\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  | 6\njmp -3  | 7\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\njmp -4  | 5\nacc +6  |\n```\n\nFirst, the `nop +0` does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (`acc +1`) and `jmp +4` sets the next instruction to the other `acc +1` near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, `jmp -4` executes, setting the next instruction to the only `acc +3`. It sets the accumulator to 5, and `jmp -3` causes the program to continue back at the first `acc +1`.\n\nThis is an **infinite loop**: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.\n\nImmediately **before** the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is **`5`**.\n\nRun your copy of the boot code.

Furthermore, the same rules for cycle updating still apply: during each cycle, consider the **number of active neighbors** of each cube.\n\nFor example, consider the same initial state as in the example above. Even though the pocket dimension is 4-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1x1 region of the 4-dimensional space.)\n\nSimulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given `z` and `w` coordinate:\n\n```\nBefore any cycles:\n\nz=0, w=0\n.#.\n..#\n###\n\n\nAfter 1 cycle:\n\nz=-1, w=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0, w=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=1, w=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=-1, w=0\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0, w=0\n#.#\n.##\n.#.\n\nz=1, w=0\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=-1, w=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0, w=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=1, w=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\n\nAfter 2 cycles:\n\nz=-2, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=-2\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=1, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-2, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=1, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=-1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-2, w=0\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=-1, w=0\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=0\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=1, w=0\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=0\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=-2, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=1, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=1\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-2, w=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1, w=2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=0, w=2\n###..\n##.##\n#...#\n.#..#\n.###.\n\nz=1, w=2\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nz=2, w=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n```\n\nAfter the full six-cycle boot process completes, **`848`** cubes are left in the **active** state.\n\nStarting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles in a 4-dimensional space. **How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?**"},"2a3b":function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="Your raft makes it to the tropical island; it turns out that the small crab was an excellent navigator. You make your way to the resort.\n\nAs you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't even reach the check-in desk until they've finished installing the **new tile floor**.\n\nThe tiles are all **hexagonal**; they need to be arranged in a [hex grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling) with a very specific color pattern. Not in the mood to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.\n\nThe tiles are all **white** on one side and **black** on the other. They start with the white side facing up. The lobby is large enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.\n\nA member of the renovation crew gives you a **list of the tiles that need to be flipped over** (your puzzle input). Each line in the list identifies a single tile that needs to be flipped by giving a series of steps starting from a **reference tile** in the very center of the room. (Every line starts from the same reference tile.)\n\nBecause the tiles are hexagonal, every tile has six **neighbors**: east, southeast, southwest, west, northwest, and northeast. These directions are given in your list, respectively, as `e`, `se`, `sw`, `w`, `nw`, and `ne`. A tile is identified by a series of these directions with **no delimiters**; for example, `esenee` identifies the tile you land on if you start at the reference tile and then move one tile east, one tile southeast, one tile northeast, and one tile east.\n\nEach time a tile is identified, it flips from white to black or from black to white. Tiles might be flipped more than once. For example, a line like `esew` flips a tile immediately adjacent to the reference tile, and a line like `nwwswee` flips the reference tile itself.\n\nHere is a larger example:\n\n```\nsesenwnenenewseeswwswswwnenewsewsw\nneeenesenwnwwswnenewnwwsewnenwseswesw\nseswneswswsenwwnwse\nnwnwneseeswswnenewneswwnewseswneseene\nswweswneswnenwsewnwneneseenw\neesenwseswswnenwswnwnwsewwnwsene\nsewnenenenesenwsewnenwwwse\nwenwwweseeeweswwwnwwe\nwsweesenenewnwwnwsenewsenwwsesesenwne\nneeswseenwwswnwswswnw\nnenwswwsewswnenenewsenwsenwnesesenew\nenewnwewneswsewnwswenweswnenwsenwsw\nsweneswneswneneenwnewenewwneswswnese\nswwesenesewenwneswnwwneseswwne\nenesenwswwswneneswsenwnewswseenwsese\nwnwnesenesenenwwnenwsewesewsesesew\nnenewswnwewswnenesenwnesewesw\neneswnwswnwsenenwnwnwwseeswneewsenese\nneswnwewnwnwseenwseesewsenwsweewe\nwseweeenwnesenwwwswnew\n```\n\nIn the above example, 10 tiles are flipped once (to black), and 5 more are flipped twice (to black, then back to white).

The ferry needs to take **evasive actions**!\n\nUnfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the [PA system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system) to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.\n\nThe navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character **actions** paired with integer input **values**. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:\n\n- Action `N` means to move **north** by the given value.\n- Action `S` means to move **south** by the given value.\n- Action `E` means to move **east** by the given value.\n- Action `W` means to move **west** by the given value.\n- Action `L` means to turn **left** the given number of degrees.\n- Action `R` means to turn **right** the given number of degrees.\n- Action `F` means to move **forward** by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.\n\nThe ship starts by facing **east**. Only the `L` and `R` actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is `N10`, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were `F`.)\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nF10\nN3\nF7\nR90\nF11\n```\n\nThese instructions would be handled as follows:\n\n- `F10` would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to east 10, north 0.\n- `N3` would move the ship 3 units north to **east 10, north 3**.\n- `F7` would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to **east 17, north 3**.\n- `R90` would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face **south**; it remains at **east 17, north 3**.\n- `F11` would move the ship 11 units south to **east 17, south 8**.\n\nAt the end of these instructions, the ship's [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is `17 + 8` = **`25`**.\n\nFigure out where the navigation instructions lead. **What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?**"},"348b":function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="With your neighbor happily enjoying their video game, you turn your attention to an open data port on the little screen in the seat in front of you.\n\nThough the port is non-standard, you manage to connect it to your computer through the clever use of several paperclips. Upon connection, the port outputs a series of numbers (your puzzle input).\n\nThe data appears to be encrypted with the eXchange-Masking Addition System (XMAS) which, conveniently for you, is an old cypher with an important weakness.\n\nXMAS starts by transmitting a **preamble** of 25 numbers. After that, each number you receive should be the sum of any two of the 25 immediately previous numbers. The two numbers will have different values, and there might be more than one such pair.\n\nFor example, suppose your preamble consists of the numbers `1` through `25` in a random order. To be valid, the next number must be the sum of two of those numbers:\n\n- `26` would be a **valid** next number, as it could be `1` plus `25` (or many other pairs, like `2` and `24`).\n- `49` would be a **valid** next number, as it is the sum of `24` and `25`.\n- `100` would **not** be valid; no two of the previous 25 numbers sum to `100`.\n- `50` would also **not** be valid; although `25` appears in the previous 25 numbers, the two numbers in the pair must be different.\n\nSuppose the 26th number is `45`, and the first number (no longer an option, as it is more than 25 numbers ago) was `20`. Now, for the next number to be valid, there needs to be some pair of numbers among `1`-`19`, `21`-`25`, or `45` that add up to it:\n\n- `26` would still be a **valid** next number, as `1` and `25` are still within the previous 25 numbers.\n- `65` would **not** be valid, as no two of the available numbers sum to it.\n- `64` and `66` would both be **valid**, as they are the result of `19+45` and `21+45` respectively.\n\nHere is a larger example which only considers the previous **5** numbers (and has a preamble of length 5):\n\n```\n35\n20\n15\n25\n47\n40\n62\n55\n65\n95\n102\n117\n150\n182\n127\n219\n299\n277\n309\n576\n```\n\nIn this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two of the previous 5 numbers; the only number that does not follow this rule is **`127`**.\n\nThe first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. **What is the first number that does not have this property?**"},"3bb7":function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="Before you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings were printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.\n\nAlmost all of the actions indicate how to move a **waypoint** which is relative to the ship's position:\n\n- Action `N` means to move the waypoint **north** by the given value.\n- Action `S` means to move the waypoint **south** by the given value.\n- Action `E` means to move the waypoint **east** by the given value.\n- Action `W` means to move the waypoint **west** by the given value.\n- Action `L` means to rotate the waypoint around the ship **left** (**counter-clockwise**) the given number of degrees.\n- Action `R` means to rotate the waypoint around the ship **right** (**clockwise**) the given number of degrees.\n- Action `F` means to move **forward** to the waypoint a number of times equal to the given value.\n\nThe waypoint starts **10 units east and 1 unit north** relative to the ship.

The computer system that runs this port isn't compatible with the docking program on the ferry, so the docking parameters aren't being correctly initialized in the docking program's memory.\n\nAfter a brief inspection, you discover that the sea port's computer system uses a strange [bitmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)) system in its initialization program. Although you don't have the correct decoder chip handy, you can emulate it in software!\n\nThe initialization program (your puzzle input) can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory. Values and memory addresses are both 36-bit unsigned integers. For example, ignoring bitmasks for a moment, a line like `mem[8] = 11` would write the value `11` to memory address `8`.\n\nThe bitmask is always given as a string of 36 bits, written with the most significant bit (representing `2^35`) on the left and the least significant bit (`2^0`, that is, the `1`s bit) on the right. The current bitmask is applied to values immediately before they are written to memory: a `0` or `1` overwrites the corresponding bit in the value, while an `X` leaves the bit in the value unchanged.\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\n```\nmask = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nmem[8] = 11\nmem[7] = 101\nmem[8] = 0\n```\n\nThis program starts by specifying a bitmask (`mask = ....`). The mask it specifies will overwrite two bits in every written value: the `2`s bit is overwritten with `0`, and the `64`s bit is overwritten with `1`.\n\nThe program then attempts to write the value `11` to memory address `8`. By expanding everything out to individual bits, the mask is applied as follows:\n\n```\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000001011  (decimal 11)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001001001  (decimal 73)\n```\n\nSo, because of the mask, the value `73` is written to memory address `8` instead. Then, the program tries to write `101` to address `7`:\n\n```\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\n```\n\nThis time, the mask has no effect, as the bits it overwrote were already the values the mask tried to set. Finally, the program tries to write `0` to address `8`:\n\n```\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000000000  (decimal 0)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001000000  (decimal 64)\n```\n\n`64` is written to address `8` instead, overwriting the value that was there previously.\n\nTo initialize your ferry's docking program, you need the sum of all values left in memory after the initialization program completes. (The entire 36-bit address space begins initialized to the value `0` at every address.) In the above example, only two values in memory are not zero - `101` (at address `7`) and `64` (at address `8`) - producing a sum of **`165`**.\n\nExecute the initialization program. **What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?**"},"44e7":function(e,n,t){var a=t("861d"),o=t("c6b6"),s=t("b622"),i=s("match");e.exports=function(e){var n;return a(e)&&(void 0!==(n=e[i])?!!n:"RegExp"==o(e))}},"460c":function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="Now that you've identified which tickets contain invalid values, **discard those tickets entirely**.

However, sometimes, allergens are listed in a language you **do** understand. You should be able to use this information to determine which ingredient contains which allergen and work out which foods are safe to take with you on your trip.\n\nYou start by compiling a list of foods (your puzzle input), one food per line. Each line includes that food's **ingredients list** followed by some or all of the allergens the food contains.\n\nEach allergen is found in exactly one ingredient. Each ingredient contains zero or one allergen. **Allergens aren't always marked**; when they're listed (as in `(contains nuts, shellfish)` after an ingredients list), the ingredient that contains each listed allergen will be **somewhere in the corresponding ingredients list**. However, even if an allergen isn't listed, the ingredient that contains that allergen could still be present: maybe they forgot to label it, or maybe it was labeled in a language you don't know.\n\nFor example, consider the following list of foods:\n\n```\nmxmxvkd kfcds sqjhc nhms (contains dairy, fish)\ntrh fvjkl sbzzf mxmxvkd (contains dairy)\nsqjhc fvjkl (contains soy)\nsqjhc mxmxvkd sbzzf (contains fish)\n```\n\nThe first food in the list has four ingredients (written in a language you don't understand): `mxmxvkd`, `kfcds`, `sqjhc`, and `nhms`. While the food might contain other allergens, a few allergens the food definitely contains are listed afterward: `dairy` and `fish`.\n\nThe first step is to determine which ingredients **can't possibly** contain any of the allergens in any food in your list. In the above example, none of the ingredients `kfcds`, `nhms`, `sbzzf`, or `trh` can contain an allergen. Counting the number of times any of these ingredients appear in any ingredients list produces **`5`**: they all appear once each except sbzzf, which appears twice.\n\nDetermine which ingredients cannot possibly contain any of the allergens in your list. **How many times do any of those ingredients appear?**"},"6c27":function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]='As your flight approaches the regional airport where you\'ll switch to a much larger plane, [customs declaration forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_declaration) are distributed to the passengers.\n\nThe form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked `a` through `z`.

Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the **front** (0 through 63) or the **back** (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you\'re left with exactly one row.\n\nFor example, consider just the first seven characters of `FBFBBFFRLR`:\n\n- Start by considering the whole range, rows `0` through `127`.\n- `F` means to take the lower half, keeping rows `0` through `63`.\n- `B` means to take the upper half, keeping rows `32` through `63`.\n- `F` means to take the lower half, keeping rows `32` through `47`.\n- `B` means to take the upper half, keeping rows `40` through `47`.\n- `B` keeps rows `44` through `47`.\n- `F` keeps rows `44` through `45`.\n- The final `F` keeps the lower of the two, row `44`.\n\nThe last three characters will be either `L` or `R`; these specify exactly one of the **8 columns** of seats on the plane (numbered `0` through `7`). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. `L` means to keep the **lower half**, while `R` means to keep the **upper half**.\n\nFor example, consider just the last 3 characters of `FBFBBFFRLR`:\n\n- Start by considering the whole range, columns `0` through `7`.\n- `R` means to take the upper half, keeping columns `4` through `7`.\n- `L` means to take the lower half, keeping columns `4` through `5`.\n- The final `R` keeps the upper of the two, column `5`.\n\nSo, decoding `FBFBBFFRLR` reveals that it is the seat at **row `44`, column `5`**.\n\nEvery seat also has a unique **seat ID**: multiply the row by `8`, then add the column.

They're playing a **memory game** and are ever so excited to explain the rules!\n\nIn this game, the players take turns saying **numbers**. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of **starting numbers** (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the **most recently spoken number**:\n\n- If that was the **first** time the number has been spoken, the current player says **`0`**.\n- Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces **how many turns apart** the number is from when it was previously spoken.\n\nSo, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking aloud either **`0`** (if the last number is new) or an **age** (if the last number is a repeat).\n\nFor example, suppose the starting numbers are `0,3,6`:\n\n- **Turn 1**: The `1`st number spoken is a starting number, **`0`**.\n- **Turn 2**: The `2`nd number spoken is a starting number, **`3`**.\n- **Turn 3**: The `3`rd number spoken is a starting number, **`6`**.\n- **Turn 4**: Now, consider the last number spoken, `6`. Since that was the first time the number had been spoken, the `4`th number spoken is **`0`**.\n- **Turn 5**: Next, again consider the last number spoken, `0`. Since it **had** been spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, `4`) and the turn number of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn `1`). Thus, the `5`th number spoken is `4 - 1`, **`3`**.\n- **Turn 6**: The last number spoken, `3` had also been spoken before, most recently on turns `5` and `2`. So, the `6`th number spoken is `5 - 2`, **`3`**.\n- **Turn 7**: Since `3` was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns are `1` turn apart, the `7`th number spoken is **`1`**.\n- **Turn 8**: Since `1` is new, the `8`th number spoken is **`0`**.\n- **Turn 9**: `0` was last spoken on turns `8` and `4`, so the `9`th number spoken is the difference between them, **`4`**.\n- **Turn 10**: `4` is new, so the `10`th number spoken is **`0`**.\n\n(The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready, whichever comes first.)\n\nTheir question for you is: what will be the **`2020`th** number spoken?

You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out **the fields these tickets must have** and **the valid ranges** for values in those fields.\n\nYou collect the **rules for ticket fields**, the **numbers on your ticket**, and the **numbers on other nearby tickets** for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).\n\nThe **rules for ticket fields** specify a list of fields that exist **somewhere** on the ticket and the **valid ranges of values** for each field. For example, a rule like `class: 1-3 or 5-7` means that one of the fields in every ticket is named `class` and can be any value in the ranges `1-3` or `5-7` (inclusive, such that `3` and `5` are both valid in this field, but `4` is not).\n\nEach ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:\n\n```\n.--------------------------------------------------------.\n| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |\n|                                                        |\n| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |\n| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |\n'--------------------------------------------------------'\n```\n\nHere, `?` represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as `101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403`; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are **much** more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!\n\nStart by determining which tickets are **completely invalid**; these are tickets that contain values which **aren't valid for any field**. Ignore **your ticket** for now.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following notes:\n\n```\nclass: 1-3 or 5-7\nrow: 6-11 or 33-44\nseat: 13-40 or 45-50\n\nyour ticket:\n7,1,14\n\nnearby tickets:\n7,3,47\n40,4,50\n55,2,20\n38,6,12\n```\n\nIt doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid **nearby tickets** by considering only whether tickets contain **values that are not valid for any field**. In this example, the values on the first **nearby ticket** are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three **nearby tickets**: the values `4`, `55`, and `12` are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your **ticket scanning error rate**: `4 + 55 + 12` = **`71`**.\n\nConsider the validity of the **nearby tickets** you scanned. **What is your ticket scanning error rate?**"},a498:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]='As you look over the list of messages, you realize your matching rules aren\'t quite right.

Then, the game consists of a series of **rounds**: both players draw their top card, and the player with the higher-valued card wins the round. The winner keeps both cards, placing them on the bottom of their own deck so that the winner's card is above the other card. If this causes a player to have all of the cards, they win, and the game ends.\n\nFor example, consider the following starting decks:\n\n```\nPlayer 1:\n9\n2\n6\n3\n1\n\nPlayer 2:\n5\n8\n4\n7\n10\n```\n\nThis arrangement means that player 1's deck contains 5 cards, with `9` on top and `1` on the bottom; player 2's deck also contains 5 cards, with `5` on top and `10` on the bottom.\n\nThe first round begins with both players drawing the top card of their decks: `9` and `5`. Player 1 has the higher card, so both cards move to the bottom of player 1's deck such that `9` is above `5`. In total, it takes 29 rounds before a player has all of the cards:\n\n```\n-- Round 1 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 9, 2, 6, 3, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 5, 8, 4, 7, 10\nPlayer 1 plays: 9\nPlayer 2 plays: 5\nPlayer 1 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 2 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 2, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5\nPlayer 2's deck: 8, 4, 7, 10\nPlayer 1 plays: 2\nPlayer 2 plays: 8\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 3 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 6, 3, 1, 9, 5\nPlayer 2's deck: 4, 7, 10, 8, 2\nPlayer 1 plays: 6\nPlayer 2 plays: 4\nPlayer 1 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 4 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4\nPlayer 2's deck: 7, 10, 8, 2\nPlayer 1 plays: 3\nPlayer 2 plays: 7\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 5 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 1, 9, 5, 6, 4\nPlayer 2's deck: 10, 8, 2, 7, 3\nPlayer 1 plays: 1\nPlayer 2 plays: 10\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n...several more rounds pass...\n\n-- Round 27 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 5, 4, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6\nPlayer 1 plays: 5\nPlayer 2 plays: 8\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 28 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 4, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5\nPlayer 1 plays: 4\nPlayer 2 plays: 9\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 29 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4\nPlayer 1 plays: 1\nPlayer 2 plays: 7\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n\n== Post-game results ==\nPlayer 1's deck: \nPlayer 2's deck: 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 7, 1\n```\n\nOnce the game ends, you can calculate the winning player's **score**. The bottom card in their deck is worth the value of the card multiplied by 1, the second-from-the-bottom card is worth the value of the card multiplied by 2, and so on. With 10 cards, the top card is worth the value on the card multiplied by 10. In this example, the winning player's score is:\n\n```\n   3 * 10\n+  2 *  9\n+ 10 *  8\n+  6 *  7\n+  8 *  6\n+  5 *  5\n+  9 *  4\n+  4 *  3\n+  7 *  2\n+  1 *  1\n= 306\n```\n\nSo, once the game ends, the winning player's score is **`306`**.\n\nPlay the small crab in a game of Combat using the two decks you just dealt. **What is the winning player's score?**"},ae49:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="The shuttle company is running a contest: one gold coin for anyone that can find the earliest timestamp such that the first bus ID departs at that time and each subsequent listed bus ID departs at that subsequent minute.

For example, in the list above, because bus ID `19` must depart seven minutes after the timestamp at which bus ID `7` departs, bus ID `7` will always **also** be departing with bus ID `19` at seven minutes after timestamp `t`.\n\nIn this example, the earliest timestamp at which this occurs is **`1068781`**:\n\n```\ntime     bus 7   bus 13  bus 59  bus 31  bus 19\n1068773    .       .       .       .       .\n1068774    D       .       .       .       .\n1068775    .       .       .       .       .\n1068776    .       .       .       .       .\n1068777    .       .       .       .       .\n1068778    .       .       .       .       .\n1068779    .       .       .       .       .\n1068780    .       .       .       .       .\n1068781    D       .       .       .       .\n1068782    .

This is fine; the only requirement on that minute is that bus ID `19` departs then, and it does.\n\nHere are some other examples:\n\n- The earliest timestamp that matches the list `17,x,13,19` is **`3417`**.\n- `67,7,59,61` first occurs at timestamp **`754018`**.\n- `67,x,7,59,61` first occurs at timestamp **`779210`**.\n- `67,7,x,59,61` first occurs at timestamp **`1261476`**.\n- `1789,37,47,1889` first occurs at timestamp **`1202161486`**.\n\nHowever, with so many bus IDs in your list, surely the actual earliest timestamp will be larger than `100000000000000`!\n\n**What is the earliest timestamp such that all of the listed bus IDs depart at offsets matching their positions in the list?**"},af9a:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="Due to what you can only assume is a mistranslation (you're not exactly fluent in Crab), you are quite surprised when the crab starts arranging **many** cups in a circle on your raft - **one million** (`1000000`) in total.\n\nYour labeling is still correct for the first few cups; after that, the remaining cups are just numbered in an increasing fashion starting from the number after the highest number in your list and proceeding one by one until one million is reached.

They'd like some help debugging a malfunctioning experimental energy source aboard one of their super-secret imaging satellites.\n\nThe experimental energy source is based on cutting-edge technology: a set of Conway Cubes contained in a pocket dimension! When you hear it's having problems, you can't help but agree to take a look.\n\nThe pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (`x,y,z`), there exists a single cube which is either **active** or **inactive**.\n\nIn the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start **inactive**. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes (your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified **active** (`#`) or **inactive** (`.`) state.\n\nThe energy source then proceeds to boot up by executing six **cycles**.\n\nEach cube only ever considers its **neighbors**: any of the 26 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most `1`. For example, given the cube at `x=1,y=2,z=3`, its neighbors include the cube at `x=2,y=2,z=2`, the cube at `x=0,y=2,z=3`, and so on.\n\nDuring a cycle, **all** cubes **simultaneously** change their state according to the following rules:\n\n- If a cube is **active** and **exactly** `2` or `3` of its neighbors are also active, the cube remains **active**. Otherwise, the cube becomes **inactive**.\n- If a cube is **inactive** but **exactly** `3` of its neighbors are active, the cube becomes **active**. Otherwise, the cube remains **inactive**.\n\nThe engineers responsible for this experimental energy source would like you to simulate the pocket dimension and determine what the configuration of cubes should be at the end of the six-cycle boot process.\n\nFor example, consider the following initial state:\n```\n.#.\n..#\n###\n```\n\nEven though the pocket dimension is 3-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1 region of the 3-dimensional space.)\n\nSimulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given `z` coordinate (and the frame of view follows the active cells in each cycle):\n\n```\nBefore any cycles:\n\nz=0\n.#.\n..#\n###\n\n\nAfter 1 cycle:\n\nz=-1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\nz=0\n#.#\n.##\n.#.\n\nz=1\n#..\n..#\n.#.\n\n\nAfter 2 cycles:\n\nz=-2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\nz=-1\n..#..\n.#..#\n....#\n.#...\n.....\n\nz=0\n##...\n##...\n#....\n....#\n.###.\n\nz=1\n..#..\n.#..#\n....#\n.#...\n.....\n\nz=2\n.....\n.....\n..#..\n.....\n.....\n\n\nAfter 3 cycles:\n\nz=-2\n.......\n.......\n..##...\n..###..\n.......\n.......\n.......\n\nz=-1\n..#....\n...#...\n#......\n.....##\n.#...#.\n..#.#..\n...#...\n\nz=0\n...#...\n.......\n#......\n.......\n.....##\n.##.#..\n...#...\n\nz=1\n..#....\n...#...\n#......\n.....##\n.#...#.\n..#.#..\n...#...\n\nz=2\n.......\n.......\n..##...\n..###..\n.......\n.......\n.......\n```\n\nAfter the full six-cycle boot process completes, **`112`** cubes are left in the **active** state.\n\nStarting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles. **How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?**"},c08b:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="Patched into the aircraft's data port, you discover weather forecasts of a massive tropical storm.

Always prepared, you make a list of all of the joltage adapters in your bag.\n\nEach of your joltage adapters is rated for a specific **output joltage** (your puzzle input).

Of these, only one you have is an adapter rated `1` jolt (difference of **`1`**).\n- From your `1`-jolt rated adapter, the only choice is your `4`-jolt rated adapter (difference of **`3`**).\n- From the `4`-jolt rated adapter, the adapters rated `5`, `6`, or `7` are valid choices. However, in order to not skip any adapters, you have to pick the adapter rated `5` jolts (difference of **`1`**).\n- Similarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated `6` and then the adapter rated `7` (with difference of **`1`** and **`1`**).\n- The only adapter that works with the `7`-jolt rated adapter is the one rated `10` jolts (difference of **`3`**).\n- From `10`, the choices are `11` or `12`; choose `11` (difference of **`1`**) and then `12` (difference of **`1`**).\n- After `12`, only valid adapter has a rating of `15` (difference of **`3`**), then `16` (difference of **`1`**), then `19` (difference of **`3`**).\n- Finally, your device's built-in adapter is always `3` higher than the highest adapter, so its rating is `22` jolts (always a difference of **`3`**).\n\nIn this example, when using every adapter, there are **`7`** differences of 1 jolt and **`5`** differences of 3 jolts.\n\nHere is a larger example:\n\n```\n28\n33\n18\n42\n31\n14\n46\n20\n48\n47\n24\n23\n49\n45\n19\n38\n39\n11\n1\n32\n25\n35\n8\n17\n7\n9\n4\n2\n34\n10\n3\n```\n\nIn this larger example, in a chain that uses all of the adapters, there are **`22`** differences of 1 jolt and **`10`** differences of 3 jolts.\n\nFind a chain that uses all of your adapters to connect the charging outlet to your device's built-in adapter and count the joltage differences between the charging outlet, the adapters, and your device. **What is the number of 1-jolt differences multiplied by the number of 3-jolt differences?**"},c202:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="As soon as people start to arrive, you realize your mistake.

They are removed from the circle; cup spacing is adjusted as necessary to maintain the circle.\n- The crab selects a **destination cup**: the cup with a **label** equal to the **current cup's** label minus one.

The following rules are applied to every seat simultaneously:\n\n- If a seat is **empty** (`L`) and there are **no** occupied seats adjacent to it, the seat becomes occupied.\n- If a seat is **occupied** (`#`) and **four or more** seats adjacent to it are also occupied, the seat becomes **empty**.\n- Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.\n\nFloor (`.`) never changes; seats don't move, and nobody sits on the floor.\n\nAfter one round of these rules, every seat in the example layout becomes occupied:\n\n```\n#.##.##.##\n#######.##\n#.#.#..#..\n####.##.##\n#.##.##.##\n#.#####.##\n..#.#.....\n##########\n#.######.#\n#.#####.##\n```\n\nAfter a second round, the seats with four or more occupied adjacent seats become empty again:\n\n```\n#.LL.L#.##\n#LLLLLL.L#\nL.L.L..L..\n#LLL.LL.L#\n#.LL.LL.LL\n#.LLLL#.##\n..L.L.....\n#LLLLLLLL#\n#.LLLLLL.L\n#.#LLLL.##\n```\n\nThis process continues for three more rounds:\n\n```\n#.##.L#.##\n#L###LL.L#\nL.#.#..#..\n#L##.##.L#\n#.##.LL.LL\n#.###L#.##\n..#.#.....\n#L######L#\n#.LL###L.L\n#.#L###.##\n```\n\n```\n#.#L.L#.##\n#LLL#LL.L#\nL.L.L..#..\n#LLL.##.L#\n#.LL.LL.LL\n#.LL#L#.##\n..L.L.....\n#L#LLLL#L#\n#.LLLLLL.L\n#.#L#L#.##\n```\n\n```\n#.#L.L#.##\n#LLL#LL.L#\nL.#.L..#..\n#L##.##.L#\n#.#L.LL.LL\n#.#L#L#.##\n..L.L.....\n#L#L##L#L#\n#.LLLLLL.L\n#.#L#L#.##\n```\n\nAt this point, something interesting happens: the chaos stabilizes and further applications of these rules cause no seats to change state! Once people stop moving around, you count **`37`** occupied seats.\n\nSimulate your seating area by applying the seating rules repeatedly until no seats change state. **How many seats end up occupied?**"},ce0c:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="After some careful analysis, you believe that **exactly one instruction is corrupted**.\n\nSomewhere in the program, **either** a `jmp` is supposed to be a `nop`, **or** a `nop` is supposed to be a `jmp`. (No `acc` instructions were harmed in the corruption of this boot code.)\n\nThe program is supposed to terminate by **attempting to execute an instruction immediately after the last instruction in the file**. By changing exactly one `jmp` or `nop`, you can repair the boot code and make it terminate correctly.\n\nFor example, consider the same program from above:\n\n```\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\n```\n\nIf you change the first instruction from `nop +0` to `jmp +0`, it would create a single-instruction infinite loop, never leaving that instruction. If you change almost any of the jmp instructions, the program will still eventually find another jmp instruction and loop forever.\n\nHowever, if you change the second-to-last instruction (from `jmp -4` to `nop -4`), the program terminates! The instructions are visited in this order:\n\n```\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  |\njmp -3  |\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\nnop -4  | 5\nacc +6  | 6\n```\n\nAfter the last instruction (`acc +6`), the program terminates by attempting to run the instruction below the last instruction in the file. With this change, after the program terminates, the accumulator contains the value **`8`** (`acc +1`, `acc +1`, `acc +6`).\n\nFix the program so that it terminates normally by changing exactly one `jmp` (to `nop`) or `nop` (to `jmp`). **What is the value of the accumulator after the program terminates?**"},cf79:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]="Now, you're ready to **check the image for sea monsters**.\n\nThe borders of each tile are not part of the actual image; start by removing them.\n\nIn the example above, the tiles become:\n\n```\n.#.#..#. ##...#.# #..#####\n###....# .#....#. .#......\n##.##.## #.#.#..# #####...\n###.#### #...#.## ###.#..#\n##.#.... #.##.### #...#.##\n...##### ###.#... .#####.#\n....#..# ...##..# .#.###..\n.####... #..#.... .#......\n\n#..#.##. .#..###. #.##....\n#.####.. #.####.# .#.###..\n###.#.#. ..#.#### ##.#..##\n#.####.. ..##..## ######.#\n##..##.# ...#...# .#.#.#..\n...#..#. .#.#.##. .###.###\n.#.#.... #.##.#.. .###.##.\n###.#... #..#.##. ######..\n\n.#.#.### .##.##.# ..#.##..\n.####.## #.#...## #.#..#.#\n..#.#..# ..#.#.#. ####.###\n#..####. ..#.#.#. ###.###.\n#####..# ####...# ##....##\n#.##..#. .#...#.. ####...#\n.#.###.. ##..##.. ####.##.\n...###.. .##...#. ..#..###\n```\n\nRemove the gaps to form the actual image:\n\n```\n.#.#..#.##...#.##..#####\n###....#.#....#..#......\n##.##.###.#.#..######...\n###.#####...#.#####.#..#\n##.#....#.##.####...#.##\n...########.#....#####.#\n....#..#...##..#.#.###..\n.####...#..#.....#......\n#..#.##..#..###.#.##....\n#.####..#.####.#.#.###..\n###.#.#...#.######.#..##\n#.####....##..########.#\n##..##.#...#...#.#.#.#..\n...#..#..#.#.##..###.###\n.#.#....#.##.#...###.##.\n###.#...#..#.##.######..\n.#.#.###.##.##.#..#.##..\n.####.###.#...###.#..#.#\n..#.#..#..#.#.#.####.###\n#..####...#.#.#.###.###.\n#####..#####...###....##\n#.##..#..#...#..####...#\n.#.###..##..##..####.##.\n...###...##...#...#..###\n```\n\nNow, you're ready to search for sea monsters!

They\'re curious if you could help them with their math homework.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like this "math" [follows different rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QtRK7Y2pPU&t=15) than you remember.\n\nThe homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions that consist of addition (`+`), multiplication (`*`), and parentheses (`(...)`). Just like normal math, parentheses indicate that the expression inside must be evaluated before it can be used by the surrounding expression. Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the product.\n\nHowever, the rules of **operator precedence** have changed. Rather than evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the **same precedence**, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the order in which they appear.\n\nFor example, the steps to evaluate the expression `1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6` are as follows:\n\n```\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n  3   * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n      9   + 4 * 5 + 6\n         13   * 5 + 6\n             65   + 6\n                 71\n```\n\nParentheses can override this order; for example, here is what happens if parentheses are added to form `1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))`:\n\n```\n1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))\n1 +    6    + (4 * (5 + 6))\n     7      + (4 * (5 + 6))\n     7      + (4 *   11   )\n     7      +     44\n            51\n```\n\nHere are a few more examples:\n\n- `2 * 3 + (4 * 5)` becomes **`26`**.\n- `5 + (8 * 3 + 9 + 3 * 4 * 3)` becomes **`437`**.\n- `5 * 9 * (7 * 3 * 3 + 9 * 3 + (8 + 6 * 4))` becomes **`12240`**.\n- `((2 + 4 * 9) * (6 + 9 * 8 + 6) + 6) + 2 + 4 * 2` becomes **`13632`**.\n\nBefore you can help with the homework, you need to understand it yourself. **Evaluate the expression on each line of the homework; what is the sum of the resulting values?**'},d784:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t("ac1f");var a=t("6eeb"),o=t("d039"),s=t("b622"),i=t("9263"),r=t("9112"),l=s("species"),h=!o((function(){var e=/./;return e.exec=function(){var e=[];return e.groups={a:"7"},e},"7"!=="".replace(e,"$<a>")})),u=function(){return"$0"==="a".replace(/./,"$0")}(),c=s("replace"),d=function(){return!!/./[c]&&""===/./[c]("a","$0")}(),m=!o((function(){var e=/(?:)/,n=e.exec;e.exec=function(){return n.apply(this,arguments)};var t="ab".split(e);return 2!==t.length||"a"!==t[0]||"b"!==t[1]}));e.exports=function(e,n,t,c){var p=s(e),b=!o((function(){var n={};return n[p]=function(){return 7},7!=""[e](n)})),y=b&&!o((function(){var n=!1,t=/a/;return"split"===e&&(t={},t.constructor={},t.constructor[l]=function(){return t},t.flags="",t[p]=/./[p]),t.exec=function(){return n=!0,null},t[p](""),!n}));if(!b||!y||"replace"===e&&(!h||!u||d)||"split"===e&&!m){var f=/./[p],g=t(p,""[e],(function(e,n,t,a,o){return n.exec===i?b&&!o?{done:!0,value:f.call(n,t,a)}:{done:!0,value:e.call(t,n,a)}:{done:!1}}),{REPLACE_KEEPS_$0:u,REGEXP_REPLACE_SUBSTITUTES_UNDEFINED_CAPTURE:d}),w=g[0],v=g[1];a(String.prototype,e,w),a(RegExp.prototype,p,2==n?function(e,n){return v.call(e,this,n)}:function(e){return v.call(e,this)})}c&&r(RegExp.prototype[p],"sham",!0)}},df6b:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n["default"]='You land in an airport surrounded by dense forest. As you walk to your high-speed train, the Elves at the Mythical Information Bureau contact you again. They think their satellite has collected an image of a **sea monster**! Unfortunately, the connection to the satellite is having problems, and many of the messages sent back from the satellite have been corrupted.\n\nThey sent you a list of **the rules valid messages should obey** and a list of **received messages** they\'ve collected so far (your puzzle input).\n\nThe **rules for valid messages** (the top part of your puzzle input) are numbered and build upon each other. For example:\n\n```\n0: 1 2\n1: "a"\n2: 1 3 | 3 1\n3: "b"\n```\n\nSome rules, like `3: "b"`, simply match a single character (in this case, `b`).\n\nThe remaining rules list the sub-rules that must be followed; for example, the rule `0: 1 2` means that to match rule `0`, the text being checked must match rule `1`, and the text after the part that matched rule `1` must then match rule `2`.\n\nSome of the rules have multiple lists of sub-rules separated by a pipe (|). This means that **at least one** list of sub-rules must match. (The ones that match might be different each time the rule is encountered.) For example, the rule `2: 1 3 | 3 1` means that to match rule `2`, the text being checked must match rule `1` followed by rule `3` or it must match rule `3` followed by rule `1`.\n\nFortunately, there are no loops in the rules, so the list of possible matches will be finite. Since rule `1` matches `a` and rule `3` matches `b`, rule `2` matches either `ab` or `ba`. Therefore, rule `0` matches `aab` or `aba`.\n\nHere\'s a more interesting example:\n\n```\n0: 4 1 5\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\n4: "a"\n5: "b"\n```\n\nHere, because rule `4` matches `a` and rule `5` matches `b`, rule 2 matches two letters that are the same (`aa` or `bb`), and rule `3` matches two letters that are different (`ab` or `ba`).\n\nSince rule `1` matches rules `2` and `3` once each in either order, it must match two pairs of letters, one pair with matching letters and one pair with different letters. This leaves eight possibilities: `aaab`, `aaba`, `bbab`, `bbba`, `abaa`, `abbb`, `baaa`, or `babb`.\n\nRule `0`, therefore, matches `a` (rule `4`), then any of the eight options from rule `1`, then `b` (rule `5`): `aaaabb`, `aaabab`, `abbabb`, `abbbab`, `aabaab`, `aabbbb`, `abaaab`, or `ababbb`.\n\nThe **received messages** (the bottom part of your puzzle input) need to be checked against the rules so you can determine which are valid and which are corrupted. Including the rules and the messages together, this might look like:\n\n```\n0: 4 1 5\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\n4: "a"\n5: "b"\n\nababbb\nbababa\nabbbab\naaabbb\naaaabbb\n```\n\nYour goal is to determine **the number of messages that completely match rule `0`**. In the above example, `ababbb` and `abbbab` match, but `bababa`, `aaabbb`, and `aaaabbb` do not, producing the answer **`2`**. The whole message must match all of rule `0`; there can\'t be extra unmatched characters in the message.

If collecting cards by winning the round causes a player to have all of the cards, they win, and the game ends.\n\nHere is an example of a small game that would loop forever without the infinite game prevention rule:\n\n```\nPlayer 1:\n43\n19\n\nPlayer 2:\n2\n29\n14\n```\n\nDuring a round of Recursive Combat, if both players have at least as many cards in their own decks as the number on the card they just dealt, the winner of the round is determined by recursing into a sub-game of Recursive Combat. (For example, if player 1 draws the `3` card, and player 2 draws the `7` card, this would occur if player 1 has at least 3 cards left and player 2 has at least 7 cards left, not counting the `3` and `7` cards that were drawn.)\n\nTo play a sub-game of Recursive Combat, each player creates a new deck by making a **copy** of the next cards in their deck (the quantity of cards copied is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger the sub-game). During this sub-game, the game that triggered it is on hold and completely unaffected; no cards are removed from players' decks to form the sub-game. (For example, if player 1 drew the 3 card, their deck in the sub-game would be **copies** of the next three cards in their deck.)\n\nHere is a complete example of gameplay, where `Game 1` is the primary game of Recursive Combat:\n\n```\n=== Game 1 ===\n\n-- Round 1 (Game 1) --\nPlayer 1's deck: 9, 2, 6, 3, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 5, 8, 4, 7, 10\nPlayer 1 plays: 9\nPlayer 2 plays: 5\nPlayer 1 wins
