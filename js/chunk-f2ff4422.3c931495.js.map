Instead, it acts as a [memory address decoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvfhANgLrm4). Immediately before a value is written to memory, each bit in the bitmask modifies the corresponding bit of the destination **memory address** in the following way:\\n\\n- If the bitmask bit is `0`, the corresponding memory address bit is **unchanged**.\\n- If the bitmask bit is `1`, the corresponding memory address bit is **overwritten with `1`**.\\n- If the bitmask bit is `X`, the corresponding memory address bit is **floating**.\\n\\nA **floating** bit is not connected to anything and instead fluctuates unpredictably. In practice, this means the floating bits will take on **all possible values**, potentially causing many memory addresses to be written all at once!\\n\\nFor example, consider the following program:\\n\\n```\\nmask = 000000000000000000000000000000X1001X\\nmem[42] = 100\\nmask = 00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX\\nmem[26] = 1\\n```\\n\\nWhen this program goes to write to memory address `42`, it first applies the bitmask:\\n\\n```\\naddress: 000000000000000000000000000000101010  (decimal 42)\\nmask:    000000000000000000000000000000X1001X\\nresult:  000000000000000000000000000000X1101X\\n```\\n\\nAfter applying the mask, four bits are overwritten, three of which are different, and two of which are **floating**. Floating bits take on every possible combination of values; with two floating bits, four actual memory addresses are written:\\n\\n```\\n000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\\n000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)\\n000000000000000000000000000000111010  (decimal 58)\\n000000000000000000000000000000111011  (decimal 59)\\n```\\n\\nNext, the program is about to write to memory address `26` with a different bitmask:\\n\\n```\\naddress: 000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\\nmask:    00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX\\nresult:  00000000000000000000000000000001X0XX\\n```\\n\\nThis results in an address with three floating bits, causing writes to **eight** memory addresses:\\n```\\n000000000000000000000000000000010000  (decimal 16)\\n000000000000000000000000000000010001  (decimal 17)\\n000000000000000000000000000000010010  (decimal 18)\\n000000000000000000000000000000010011  (decimal 19)\\n000000000000000000000000000000011000  (decimal 24)\\n000000000000000000000000000000011001  (decimal 25)\\n000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\\n000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)\\n```\\n\\nThe entire 36-bit address space still begins initialized to the value 0 at every address, and you still need the sum of all values left in memory at the end of the program.

Each instruction consists of an **operation** (`acc`, `jmp`, or `nop`) and an **argument** (a signed number like `+4` or `-20`).\\n\\n- `acc` increases or decreases a single global value called the **accumulator** by the value given in the argument. For example, `acc +7` would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at `0`.

The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an **offset** from the `jmp` instruction; for example, `jmp +2` would skip the next instruction, `jmp +1` would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and `jmp -20` would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.\\n- `nop` stands for **No OPeration** - it does nothing.

Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (`acc +1`) and `jmp +4` sets the next instruction to the other `acc +1` near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, `jmp -4` executes, setting the next instruction to the only `acc +3`. It sets the accumulator to 5, and `jmp -3` causes the program to continue back at the first `acc +1`.\\n\\nThis is an **infinite loop**: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever.

To be valid, the next number must be the sum of two of those numbers:\\n\\n- `26` would be a **valid** next number, as it could be `1` plus `25` (or many other pairs, like `2` and `24`).\\n- `49` would be a **valid** next number, as it is the sum of `24` and `25`.\\n- `100` would **not** be valid; no two of the previous 25 numbers sum to `100`.\\n- `50` would also **not** be valid; although `25` appears in the previous 25 numbers, the two numbers in the pair must be different.\\n\\nSuppose the 26th number is `45`, and the first number (no longer an option, as it is more than 25 numbers ago) was `20`. Now, for the next number to be valid, there needs to be some pair of numbers among `1`-`19`, `21`-`25`, or `45` that add up to it:\\n\\n- `26` would still be a **valid** next number, as `1` and `25` are still within the previous 25 numbers.\\n- `65` would **not** be valid, as no two of the available numbers sum to it.\\n- `64` and `66` would both be **valid**, as they are the result of `19+45` and `21+45` respectively.\\n\\nHere is a larger example which only considers the previous **5** numbers (and has a preamble of length 5):\\n\\n```\\n35\\n20\\n15\\n25\\n47\\n40\\n62\\n55\\n65\\n95\\n102\\n117\\n150\\n182\\n127\\n219\\n299\\n277\\n309\\n576\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two of the previous 5 numbers; the only number that does not follow this rule is **`127`**.\\n\\nThe first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. **What is the first number that does not have this property?**\";","export default \"Before you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings were printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.\\n\\nAlmost all of the actions indicate how to move a **waypoint** which is relative to the ship's position:\\n\\n- Action `N` means to move the waypoint **north** by the given value.\\n- Action `S` means to move the waypoint **south** by the given value.\\n- Action `E` means to move the waypoint **east** by the given value.\\n- Action `W` means to move the waypoint **west** by the given value.\\n- Action `L` means to rotate the waypoint around the ship **left** (**counter-clockwise**) the given number of degrees.\\n- Action `R` means to rotate the waypoint around the ship **right** (**clockwise**) the given number of degrees.\\n- Action `F` means to move **forward** to the waypoint a number of times equal to the given value.\\n\\nThe waypoint starts **10 units east and 1 unit north** relative to the ship.

The waypoint stays 10 units east and 1 unit north of the ship.\\n- `N3` moves the waypoint 3 units north to **10 units east and 4 units north of the ship**.

The computer system that runs this port isn't compatible with the docking program on the ferry, so the docking parameters aren't being correctly initialized in the docking program's memory.\\n\\nAfter a brief inspection, you discover that the sea port's computer system uses a strange [bitmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)) system in its initialization program. Although you don't have the correct decoder chip handy, you can emulate it in software!\\n\\nThe initialization program (your puzzle input) can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory. Values and memory addresses are both 36-bit unsigned integers. For example, ignoring bitmasks for a moment, a line like `mem[8] = 11` would write the value `11` to memory address `8`.\\n\\nThe bitmask is always given as a string of 36 bits, written with the most significant bit (representing `2^35`) on the left and the least significant bit (`2^0`, that is, the `1`s bit) on the right. The current bitmask is applied to values immediately before they are written to memory: a `0` or `1` overwrites the corresponding bit in the value, while an `X` leaves the bit in the value unchanged.\\n\\nFor example, consider the following program:\\n\\n```\\nmask = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\\nmem[8] = 11\\nmem[7] = 101\\nmem[8] = 0\\n```\\n\\nThis program starts by specifying a bitmask (`mask = ....`). The mask it specifies will overwrite two bits in every written value: the `2`s bit is overwritten with `0`, and the `64`s bit is overwritten with `1`.\\n\\nThe program then attempts to write the value `11` to memory address `8`. By expanding everything out to individual bits, the mask is applied as follows:\\n\\n```\\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000001011  (decimal 11)\\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001001001  (decimal 73)\\n```\\n\\nSo, because of the mask, the value `73` is written to memory address `8` instead. Then, the program tries to write `101` to address `7`:\\n\\n```\\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\\n```\\n\\nThis time, the mask has no effect, as the bits it overwrote were already the values the mask tried to set. Finally, the program tries to write `0` to address `8`:\\n\\n```\\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000000000  (decimal 0)\\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001000000  (decimal 64)\\n```\\n\\n`64` is written to address `8` instead, overwriting the value that was there previously.\\n\\nTo initialize your ferry's docking program, you need the sum of all values left in memory after the initialization program completes. (The entire 36-bit address space begins initialized to the value `0` at every address.) In the above example, only two values in memory are not zero - `101` (at address `7`) and `64` (at address `8`) - producing a sum of **`165`**.\\n\\nExecute the initialization program. **What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes?**\";","var isObject = require('../internals/is-object');\nvar classof = require('../internals/classof-raw');\nvar wellKnownSymbol = require('../internals/well-known-symbol');\n\nvar MATCH = wellKnownSymbol('match');\n\n// `IsRegExp` abstract operation\n// https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-isregexp\nmodule.exports = function (it) {\n  var isRegExp;\n  return isObject(it) && ((isRegExp = it[MATCH]) !== undefined ? !!isRegExp : classof(it) == 'RegExp');\n};\n","export default \"Now that you've identified which tickets contain invalid values, **discard those tickets entirely**. Use the remaining valid tickets to determine which field is which.\\n\\nUsing the valid ranges for each field, determine what order the fields appear on the tickets. The order is consistent between all tickets: if `seat` is the third field, it is the third field on every ticket, including **your ticket**.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you have the following notes:\\n\\n```\\nclass: 0-1 or 4-19\\nrow: 0-5 or 8-19\\nseat: 0-13 or 16-19\\n\\nyour ticket:\\n11,12,13\\n\\nnearby tickets:\\n3,9,18\\n15,1,5\\n5,14,9\\n```\\n\\nBased on the **nearby tickets** in the above example, the first position must be `row`, the second position must be `class`, and the third position must be `seat`; you can conclude that in **your ticket**, `class` is `12`, `row` is `11`, and `seat` is `13`.\\n\\nOnce you work out which field is which, look for the six fields on **your ticket** that start with the word `departure`. **What do you get if you multiply those six

In this example, the values on the first **nearby ticket** are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three **nearby tickets**: the values `4`, `55`, and `12` are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your **ticket scanning error rate**: `4 + 55 + 12` = **`71`**.\\n\\nConsider the validity of the **nearby tickets** you scanned. **What is your ticket scanning error rate?**\";","export default \"As you look over the list of messages, you realize your matching rules aren't quite right.

The other rules still apply: empty seats that see no occupied seats become occupied, seats matching no rule don't change, and floor never changes.\\n\\nGiven the same starting layout as above, these new rules cause the seating area to shift around as follows:\\n\\n```\\nL.LL.LL.LL\\nLLLLLLL.LL\\nL.L.L..L..\\nLLLL.LL.LL\\nL.LL.LL.LL\\nL.LLLLL.LL\\n..L.L.....\\nLLLLLLLLLL\\nL.LLLLLL.L\\nL.LLLLL.LL\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.##.##.##\\n#######.##\\n#.#.#..#..\\n####.##.##\\n#.##.##.##\\n#.#####.##\\n..#.#.....\\n##########\\n#.######.#\\n#.#####.##\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.LL.LL.L#\\n#LLLLLL.LL\\nL.L.L..L..\\nLLLL.LL.LL\\nL.LL.LL.LL\\nL.LLLLL.LL\\n..L.L.....\\nLLLLLLLLL#\\n#.LLLLLL.L\\n#.LLLLL.L#\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.L#.##.L#\\n#L#####.LL\\nL.#.#..#..\\n##L#.##.##\\n#.##.#L.##\\n#.#####.#L\\n..#.#.....\\nLLL####LL#\\n#.L#####.L\\n#.L####.L#\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.L#.L#.L#\\n#LLLLLL.LL\\nL.L.L..#..\\n##LL.LL.L#\\nL.LL.LL.L#\\n#.LLLLL.LL\\n..L.L.....\\nLLLLLLLLL#\\n#.LLLLL#.L\\n#.L#LL#.L#\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.L#.L#.L#\\n#LLLLLL.LL\\nL.L.L..#..\\n##L#.#L.L#\\nL.L#.#L.L#\\n#.L####.LL\\n..#.#.....\\nLLL###LLL#\\n#.LLLLL#.L\\n#.L#LL#.L#\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.L#.L#.L#\\n#LLLLLL.LL\\nL.L.L..#..\\n##L#.#L.L#\\nL.L#.LL.L#\\n#.LLLL#.LL\\n..#.L.....\\nLLL###LLL#\\n#.LLLLL#.L\\n#.L#LL#.L#\\n```\\n\\nAgain, at this point, people stop shifting around and the seating area reaches equilibrium. Once this occurs, you count **`26`** occupied seats.\\n\\nGiven the new visibility method and the rule change for occupied seats becoming empty, once equilibrium is reached, **how many seats end up occupied?**\";","export default \"Your plane lands with plenty of time to spare.

As you reach the waiting area to board the ferry, you realize you're so early, nobody else has even arrived yet!\\n\\nBy modeling the process people use to choose (or abandon) their seat in the waiting area, you're pretty sure you can predict the best place to sit. You make a quick map of the seat layout (your puzzle input).\\n\\nThe seat layout fits neatly on a grid. Each position is either floor (`.`), an empty seat (`L`), or an occupied seat (`#`). For example, the initial seat layout might look like this:\\n\\n```\\nL.LL.LL.LL\\nLLLLLLL.LL\\nL.L.L..L..\\nLLLL.LL.LL\\nL.LL.LL.LL\\nL.LLLLL.LL\\n..L.L.....\\nLLLLLLLLLL\\nL.LLLLLL.L\\nL.LLLLL.LL\\n```\\n\\nNow, you just need to model the people who will be arriving shortly. Fortunately, people are entirely predictable and always follow a simple set of rules. All decisions are based on the **number of occupied seats** adjacent to a given seat (one of the eight positions immediately up, down, left, right, or diagonal from the seat). The following rules are applied to every seat simultaneously:\\n\\n- If a seat is **empty** (`L`) and there are **no** occupied seats adjacent to it, the seat becomes occupied.\\n- If a seat is **occupied** (`#`) and **four or more** seats adjacent to it are also occupied, the seat becomes **empty**.\\n- Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.\\n\\nFloor (`.`) never changes; seats don't move, and nobody sits on the floor.\\n\\nAfter one round of these rules, every seat in the example layout becomes occupied:\\n\\n```\\n#.##.##.##\\n#######.##\\n#.#.#..#..\\n####.##.##\\n#.##.##.##\\n#.#####.##\\n..#.#.....\\n##########\\n#.######.#\\n#.#####.##\\n```\\n\\nAfter a second round, the seats with four or more occupied adjacent seats become empty again:\\n\\n```\\n#.LL.L#.##\\n#LLLLLL.L#\\nL.L.L..L..\\n#LLL.LL.L#\\n#.LL.LL.LL\\n#.LLLL#.##\\n..L.L.....\\n#LLLLLLLL#\\n#.LLLLLL.L\\n#.#LLLL.##\\n```\\n\\nThis process continues for three more rounds:\\n\\n```\\n#.##.L#.##\\n#L###LL.L#\\nL.#.#..#..\\n#L##.##.L#\\n#.##.LL.LL\\n#.###L#.##\\n..#.#.....\\n#L######L#\\n#.LL###L.L\\n#.#L###.##\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.#L.L#.##\\n#LLL#LL.L#\\nL.L.L..#..\\n#LLL.##.L#\\n#.LL.LL.LL\\n#.LL#L#.##\\n..L.L.....\\n#L#LLLL#L#\\n#.LLLLLL.L\\n#.#L#L#.##\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#.#L.L#.##\\n#LLL#LL.L#\\nL.#.L..#..\\n#L##.##.L#\\n#.#L.LL.LL\\n#.#L#L#.##\\n..L.L.....\\n#L#L##L#L#\\n#.LLLLLL.L\\n#.#L#L#.##\\n```\\n\\nAt this point, something interesting happens: the chaos stabilizes and further applications of these rules cause no seats to change state!

By changing exactly one `jmp` or `nop`, you can repair the boot code and make it terminate correctly.\\n\\nFor example, consider the same program from above:\\n\\n```\\nnop +0\\nacc +1\\njmp +4\\nacc +3\\njmp -3\\nacc -99\\nacc +1\\njmp -4\\nacc +6\\n```\\n\\nIf you change the first instruction from `nop +0` to `jmp +0`, it would create a single-instruction infinite loop, never leaving that instruction. If you change almost any of the jmp instructions, the program will still eventually find another jmp instruction and loop forever.\\n\\nHowever, if you change the second-to-last instruction (from `jmp -4` to `nop -4`), the program terminates!

Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the product.\\n\\nHowever, the rules of **operator precedence** have changed. Rather than evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the **same precedence**, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the order in which they appear.\\n\\nFor example, the steps to evaluate the expression `1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6` are as follows:\\n\\n```\\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\\n  3   * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\\n      9   + 4 * 5 + 6\\n         13   * 5 + 6\\n             65   + 6\\n                 71\\n```\\n\\nParentheses can override this order; for example, here is what happens if parentheses are added to form `1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))`:\\n\\n```\\n1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))\\n1 +    6    + (4 * (5 + 6))\\n     7      + (4 * (5 + 6))\\n     7      + (4 *   11   )\\n     7      +     44\\n            51\\n```\\n\\nHere are a few more examples:\\n\\n- `2 * 3 + (4 * 5)` becomes **`26`**.\\n- `5 + (8 * 3 + 9 + 3 * 4 * 3)` becomes **`437`**.\\n- `5 * 9 * (7 * 3 * 3 + 9 * 3 + (8 + 6 * 4))` becomes **`12240`**.\\n- `((2 + 4 * 9) * (6 + 9 * 8 + 6) + 6) + 2 + 4 * 2` becomes **`13632`**.\\n\\nBefore you can help with the homework, you need to understand it yourself. **Evaluate the expression on each line of the homework; what is the sum of the resulting values?**\";","'use strict';\n// TODO: Remove from `core-js@4` since it's moved to entry points\nrequire('../modules/es.regexp.exec');\nvar redefine = require('../internals/redefine');\nvar fails = require('../internals/fails');\nvar wellKnownSymbol = require('../internals/well-known-symbol');\nvar regexpExec = require('../internals/regexp-exec');\nvar createNonEnumerableProperty = require('../internals/create-non-enumerable-property');\n\nvar SPECIES = wellKnownSymbol('species');\n\nvar REPLACE_SUPPORTS_NAMED_GROUPS = !fails(function () {\n  // #replace needs built-in support for named groups.\n  // #match works fine because it just return the exec results, even if it has\n  // a \"grops\" property.\n  var re = /./;\n  re.exec = function () {\n    var result = [];\n    result.groups = { a: '7' };\n    return result;\n  };\n  return ''.replace(re, '$<a>') !== '7';\n});\n\n// IE <= 11 replaces $0 with the whole match, as if it was $&\n// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6024666/getting-ie-to-replace-a-regex-with-the-literal-string-0\nvar REPLACE_KEEPS_$0 = (function () {\n  return 'a'.replace(/./, '$0') === '$0';\n})();\n\nvar REPLACE = wellKnownSymbol('replace');\n// Safari <= 13.0.3(?) substitutes nth capture where n>m with an empty string\nvar REGEXP_REPLACE_SUBSTITUTES_UNDEFINED_CAPTURE = (function () {\n  if (/./[REPLACE]) {\n    return /./[REPLACE]('a', '$0') === '';\n  }\n  return false;\n})();\n\n// Chrome 51 has a buggy \"split\" implementation when RegExp#exec !== nativeExec\n// Weex JS has frozen built-in prototypes, so use try / catch wrapper\nvar SPLIT_WORKS_WITH_OVERWRITTEN_EXEC = !fails(function () {\n  var re = /(?:)/;\n  var originalExec = re.exec;\n  re.exec = function () { return originalExec.apply(this, arguments); };\n  var result = 'ab'.split(re);\n  return result.length !== 2 || result[0] !== 'a' || result[1] !== 'b';\n});\n\nmodule.exports = function (KEY, length, exec, sham) {\n  var SYMBOL = wellKnownSymbol(KEY);\n\n  var DELEGATES_TO_SYMBOL = !fails(function () {\n    // String methods call symbol-named RegEp methods\n    var O = {};\n    O[SYMBOL] = function () { return 7; };\n    return ''[KEY](O) != 7;\n  });\n\n  var DELEGATES_TO_EXEC = DELEGATES_TO_SYMBOL && !fails(function () {\n    // Symbol-named RegExp methods call .exec\n    var execCalled = false;\n    var re = /a/;\n\n    if (KEY === 'split') {\n      // We can't use real regex here since it causes deoptimization\n      // and serious performance degradation in V8\n      // https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/306\n      re = {};\n      // RegExp[@@split] doesn't call the regex's exec method, but first creates\n      // a new one.

This means that **at least one** list of sub-rules must match. (The ones that match might be different each time the rule is encountered.) For example, the rule `2: 1 3 | 3 1` means that to match rule `2`, the text being checked must match rule `1` followed by rule `3` or it must match rule `3` followed by rule `1`.\\n\\nFortunately, there are no loops in the rules, so the list of possible matches will be finite. Since rule `1` matches `a` and rule `3` matches `b`, rule `2` matches either `ab` or `ba`. Therefore, rule `0` matches `aab` or `aba`.\\n\\nHere's a more interesting example:\\n\\n```\\n0: 4 1 5\\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\\n4: \\\"a\\\"\\n5: \\\"b\\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere, because rule `4` matches `a` and rule `5` matches `b`, rule 2 matches two letters that are the same (`aa` or `bb`), and rule `3` matches two letters that are different (`ab` or `ba`).\\n\\nSince rule `1` matches rules `2` and `3` once each in either order, it must match two pairs of letters, one pair with matching letters and one pair with different letters. This leaves eight possibilities: `aaab`, `aaba`, `bbab`, `bbba`, `abaa`, `abbb`, `baaa`, or `babb`.\\n\\nRule `0`, therefore, matches `a` (rule `4`), then any of the eight options from rule `1`, then `b` (rule `5`): `aaaabb`, `aaabab`, `abbabb`, `abbbab`, `aabaab`, `aabbbb`, `abaaab`, or `ababbb`.\\n\\nThe **received messages** (the bottom part of your puzzle input) need to be checked against the rules so you can determine which are valid and which are corrupted. Including the rules and the messages together, this might look like:\\n\\n```\\n0: 4 1 5\\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\\n4: \\\"a\\\"\\n5: \\\"b\\\"\\n\\nababbb\\nbababa\\nabbbab\\naaabbb\\naaaabbb\\n```\\n\\nYour goal is to determine **the number of messages that completely match rule `0`**. In the above example, `ababbb` and `abbbab` match, but `bababa`, `aaabbb`, and `aaaabbb` do not, producing the answer **`2`**. The whole message must match all of rule `0`; there can't be extra unmatched characters in the message.

Multiplying the bus ID by the number of minutes you'd need to wait gives **`295`**.\\n\\n**What is the ID of the earliest bus you can take to the airport multiplied by the number of minutes you'll need to wait for that bus?**\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
